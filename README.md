# Slot-Machine
    A fun and addictive game, requires no skill but demands your attention. If you haven't played the slots,<br/> or it's been awhile, allow me paraphrase: a player places a wager and pulls a lever or pushes a button and a<br/>  series of spinning wheels (typically 3) will spin vertically. As the wheel stops, a random pattern will<br/>  emerge. If the middle row align a series of identical images, the player will win. Some series appear more<br/>  or less frequently by design, and will multiply a player's winning return at corresponding ratios. The rarest <br/> and highest pay out? **JACKPOT**!<br/> 

## How it will play onscreen
    A player will have an inviting welcome screen, displaying the resting image of a slot machine screen and a<br/>  brief example of what a win or "jackpot" would look like. State will be initialized to null in terms of<br/>  player's money but the winning combos and their corresponding multipliers will be constant in state. Player<br/>  will input his amount to be wagered and this be will be continually updated with each click of spin, <br/> subtracting the individual wager. It will **ALWAYS SUBTRACT**, adding will happen conditionally. This <br/> will be rendered onscreen after each "spin". Animation of randomly generated rows of images will display but <br/> stop in rows after a short time, spin bar will be animated as well.<br/>

## Wins
    IF player hits on a winning combo, his running total of avail money to be gambled will increase. To heighten<br/>  user experience, screen will have various screen animations to be triggered with various intensity depending<br/>  on how big the win.<br/> 

## Future Development
    For now, the game will simply have the middle of the three rows be the determining win row, but futute <br/> updates could include all three rows and diagonals for additional wagers to increase the likeleyhood of <br/> a win. I'd like to incorporate a "bonus spin" feature as well, to reward players for a certain amount of time<br/>  of money spent playing. Better animations, various payment options, sharing acheivements(wins) on social <br/> media may also be developed in the future. <br/>
